# Perined Birthweight Charts for CastorEDC

## Introduction
Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is serious condition affecting 5-10% of all pregnancies. With an increase in IVF-trajectories, expectation are that the incidence of FGR will continue to rise in the coming year. FGR is a condition in which the fetus does not reach its full growth potential. Despite advancements in obstetric diagnostic procedures, antenatal detection of FGR remains a challenge. In order to identify children at risk, birthweight and birthweight charts are used. In the Netherlands CastorEDC () is quickly becoming the most used electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) in academic hospitals and other research instances. In order to facilitate the use of the Perined Birthweight Charts for all perinatal research, a JavaScript code has been developed by Kishan Tsang. 

## How to use
The code is written for the use within the calculation forms offered by CastorEDC. Unfortunately, CastorEDC only allows a limited amount of (XXXXX) characters in this field. Therefore, the chart has been split based on sex. In CastorEDC, a dependency can be added to this calculation so that male patients will only be analyzed within the male chart and vice versa. Please use the how to below
